## Document assignment

Consider the following situation:  

A sloppy printer produces books with an average of 2 misprints per page. You want to
know how many pages have more than k misprints in a book of n pages. Make an n x k table that shows the relationship between the total number of pages in a book and the number of pages with k misprints.

Show and explain your work.  Include equations and calculations to teach the reader how to solve the problem.  Include an image of a book.

Push your solution to a github repository and submit the url for repository on blackboard.
Be sure your repo includes your document as a pdf file and as an RMD file.  Include other files needed to recompile your document.
